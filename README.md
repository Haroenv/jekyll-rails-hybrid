# The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Rails

I like Rails. And I increasingly really like Jekyll. This mashup deserves a much more thorough writeup. For now, suffice to say, if you know what I mean, then you know what I mean.

So I will address the "why?" another time. For now, here's the "what:"

### 1. A Simple Rails App

Look around. It's Rails.

### 2. A Simple Jekyll App

But wait, there's more! According to this `_config.yml`, there's a Jekyll app hiding mostly in `app/static`, which is generating the entirety of the Rails app's static `public` directory!

There are some other opinions in the `_config.yml` file (Redcloth, Pygments), but all in all it's fairly minimal.

### 3. A Bit of Glue

Because I rather like the Rails asset pipeline, and want to use _all_ of its strengths from within Jekyll, I wrote a small Jekyll plugin to provide an `asset_path` tag. This tag uses the Rails environment's own `Sprockets::Environment` to find assets and their digest paths.

Boom. Jekyll is using the Rails apps stylesheets, in all their compiled, minified, gzipped, digested glory.

Finally, we straight-up _.gitignore_ the `public` directory, and wire up a simple rake task to run a naive Jekyll build before the `assets:precompile` presumably being called somewhere in your production deploy scripts.

### 4. A Bit of Exposition

A bit more exposition to come. For now, feedback is welcome!

In particular:

- **Conventions and configurations.** Can some of this be done with less configuration?
- **Hard-coded assumptions.** I'm looking at the hardcoded `/assets` in my `asset_path` tag, and the (lack of) options in the `jekyll:build` task.

In short, how do I continue to distill this thing into the most natural and future-proof fit possible?
